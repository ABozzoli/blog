> Just do it!

That's <ExternalLink href="https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0">what <span translate="no">Shia LaBeouf</span> would say</ExternalLink>.
And I agree: I _should_ just do it. But no, I'm a perfectionist, so I totally cannot "just do" things.
That's simply not how it works.

But after _a whole friggin' year_ of having this blog sitting around, almost finished
(like most of my projects - and admit it - _most of yours too_),
I finally got tired enough to remember those very wise words:

> Just do it!

So I did it! I published the damn thing!<br aria-hidden="true"/>
...And then left it to rot for more than <time datetime="2w">two weeks</time>. Yay!

Still, <time datetime="2w">two weeks</time> is quite an improvement over one year, don't you think?

I hope you will enjoy your stay here and maybe find something useful.
I'll try to keep this the only "rambling" post on the site<FootnoteRef n="1"/>
and all the others will, of course, be *very professional*™ articles.

So, without further ado... let's <a href="articles/a11y-101-skip-links">just do it!</a>

    Who am I kidding? The <a href="category/ramblings">Ramblings</a> category exists for a reason.
