<aside class="callout">
  In <a href="category/a11y-101">this series</a>, I'll try to cover the essential components every blog needs, with a
  special focus on accessibility, _of course_. To stay on track, I might skip (_pun intended_) over some of the less
  important CSS bits, so bear with me!
</aside>

Let's start with one of the simplest yet most important components: the Skip-links.

## What are the Skip-links?

Skip-links are hidden links at the top of a webpage that let users jump directly to a specific section
(usually <Link href="#main">the main content</Link>) of the page.

They become visible when focused (via keyboard navigation) and help users skip repetitive elements like navigation menus.

## Why do we need them?

Imagine browsing a site using only your keyboard.
Every time you load a new page, you'd have to tab through every navigation link before reaching the actual content.

> Ugh, that gets tiring quickly.

Skip-links solve this problem by letting users jump straight to what matters with (almost) a single keystroke.
That’s not just accessibility: _it’s good UX_, plain and simple.

## How to build them

Start with a simple anchor inside a wrapper (the wrapper will help you with the styling and
also <a href="articles/a11y-101-skip-links#optional-add-some-more">come in handy later</a>):

```html
<div class="skip-links">
  <a>Skip to main content</a>
</div>
```

Be sure to place the Skip-links _before_ the site navigation to not defeat its purpose.
Then simply reference the `id` of the target element (typically the `<main>` landmark) in the link's `href`:

```html
<div class="skip-links">
  <a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>
</div>
...
<main id="main">...</main>
```

And <span lang="fr">voilà</span>! That's already a functional Skip-links: no JavaScript required!

### Managing visibility

Now, we want the Skip-links to remain hidden until they receive focus, so we would do something like this:

```css
.skip-links {
  position: absolute;
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}

.skip-links:focus-within {
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

This keeps the link off-screen by default and brings it into view when focused.

To make the reveal a bit more elegant, we can add a transition. Just be mindful and respect users' preferences
by wrapping it in a media query to ensure animations are disabled for those who prefer reduced motion.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .skip-links {
    transition: transform 0.3s;
  }
}
```

### Where's the focus-indicator?

By default, the `<main>` element isn't focusable, so while the browser scrolls to it and the keyboard focus moves there,
the focus-indicator doesn't show up. This can leave the user disoriented and violates
the <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible">WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible</Link>.

To fix that, simply add `tabindex="-1"` to your target:

```html
<main id="main" tabindex="-1">...</main>
```

This allows the focus-indicator to move to `<main>` when using the Skip-links,
without adding it to the regular tab order. Neat!

## Optional: add some more

If your `<footer>` includes interactive elements, consider adding a Skip-link pointing to it as well:

```html
<div class="skip-links">
  <a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>
  <a href="#footer">Skip to footer</a>
</div>
```

And while you're at it, why not use proper list semantics and slap an `aria-label` on it too?

```html
<ul class="skip-links" aria-label="Skip-links">
  <li><a href="#main">Skip to main content</a></li>
  <li><a href="#footer">Skip to footer</a></li>
</ul>
```

We are almost done, but wait!

### Hide non-focused links

Typically, only the focused link is visible. So, how do we achieve that?
We can leverage a classic accessibility hack:
the <Link href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html">visually-hidden class</Link>.

```css
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

This little beauty hides elements visually while keeping them accessible to assistive technologies and keyboard users.
When the hidden element receives focus, it becomes visible again thanks to the `:not()` part.

You just need to apply it to both anchor elements:

```html
<ul class="skip-links" aria-label="Skip-links">
  <li><a class="visually-hidden" href="#main">Skip to main content</a></li>
  <li><a class="visually-hidden" href="#footer">Skip to footer</a></li>
</ul>
```

And that's it! Now you have a simple yet accessible Skip-links component ready for your blog.
Until <a href="articles/a11y-101-back-to-top">next time</a>, be (and code) well!
