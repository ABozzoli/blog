"Just do it!"

That's <a href="https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0" target="_blank">what <span translate="no">Shia LaBeouf</span> would say<span class="visually-hidden">, opens in a new window</span></a>. And I agree - I _should_ just do it. But no, I'm a perfectionist, so I totally cannot "just do" things. That's simply not how it works.

But after a _whole friggin' year_ of having this blog sitting around, almost finished (like most of my projects - and admit it, most of yours too), I finally got tired enough to remember those very wise words:

"Just do it!"

So I did it! I published the blog on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages<span class="visually-hidden">, opens in a new window</span></a>!<br aria-hidden="true"/>
...And then left it to rot for more than <time datetime="2w">two weeks</time>. Yay!

Still, <time datetime="2w">two weeks</time> is quite an improvement over one year, don't you think?

I hope you enjoy your stay here and maybe find something useful. I'll try to keep this the only "rambling" post on the site - all the others will, of course, be *very professional*â„¢ articles.

So, without further ado... let's **just do it!**
