<a href="articles/a11y-101-skip-links">Skipping to the main content</a> is important, but what if you want to go back to
the top of a long page? Here comes our next <a href="category/a11y-101">(accessible) essential blog component</a>: the
Back-to-top.

## What is the Back-to-top?

The Back-to-top it's a button (at least aesthetically) that allows the user to move its viewport _and focus_ back to the top of the page with a single click.

## Why do we need it?

Browser _do_ provide a built-in way to scroll back to the top (like pressing the <kbd>Home</kbd> key on Windows),
however:

1. not all users are aware of it, and more importantly...
2. while it scrolls the page, it doesn't actually move the focus back to the top of the page!

This can be disorienting for keyboard and screen reader users, as they might expect to be back at the beginning of the page _with the focus too_.

## How to build it

It all starts with a simple anchor link, placed just before the footer of the page:<FootnoteRef n="1"/>

```html
<div class="back-to-top">
  <a>Back to top</a>
</div>
```

But what value should the `href` attribute have you ask?
Time to dust off our old friend, the (informal) href placeholder: the lonely hash (`#`).

Because yes, while mostly misused as a placeholder for non-functional links (_psst_, `javascript:void(0)` is what you're looking for),
the hash alone actually has a defined behavior in the browser: it takes you to the top of the page!<FootnoteRef n="2"/>

But - you guessed it - it still doesn't move the focus.
So, what's the solution?

Just as we did for the <a href="articles/a11y-101-skip-links#how-to-build-them">Skip-links</a>, we have to target the `<main>` element:

```html
<main id="main" tabindex="-1">...</main>
<div class="back-to-top">
  <a href="#main">Back to top</a>
</div>
```

<Callout>
  If you are wondering about the `tabindex="-1"` check out my article about
  <a href="articles/a11y-101-skip-links#wheres-the-focus-indicator">Skip-links</a> for the details!
</Callout>

And there we go! Both the viewport _and focus_ return to the start of the main content.

### Getting fancy

> Smooth scrolling? Yes, please!

Smooth scrolling can be easily achieved by setting `scroll-behavior: smooth` on your `<html>` element.
Just don't forget to honour user preferences by wrapping it in a media query:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
}
```

Now, you might think it'd be _super-duper cool_ to show the Back-to-top button only after scrolling.
That's fine **as long as you don't hide it while it's focused**.

If an element disappears while it has focus, it disrupts the user's navigation flow: this is a failure
of <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-order">WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 2.4.3: Focus Order</ExternalLink>.

If you really must toggle visibility,
you can do it safely in pure CSS by hiding it only when the container has `:not(:focus-within)`.

### Finishing touches

Since you might be using a solitary _arrow-up_ icon and no visible text for your Back-to-top component, be mindful about two things:

1. add an `aria-label` - or better yet - a visually-hidden text to grant an accessible name to the element;
2. hide the icon to assistive technologies with with an empty `alt=""` if it's an `<img>` or with an `aria-hidden="true"` if it's an `<svg>` or a Unicode character;
3. repeat the label in the `title` attribute<FootnoteRef n="3"/> to add a native tooltip.

The result should be something along these lines:

```html
<div class="back-to-top">
  <a href="#main" title="Back to top">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Back to top</span>
    <span aria-hidden="true">↑</span>
  </a>
</div>
```

That's it. The Back-to-top is a deceptively simple feature - it has _literally_ one purpose(!) - but still,
it's easy to miss the accessibility part by just scrolling the page visually.

Until next time, be (and code) well!

  <Footnote n="1">
    As always, the position in the DOM is fundamental, as it determines the focus order of the elements. Don't be fooled
    by the fact that you'll likely want to make it look like it's floating in the bottom corner of the viewport.

    It shares this behavior with the _very special_™ `#top` fragment (see{" "}

    ), which is more explicit and therefore arguably preferable.

    additional or critical information.
