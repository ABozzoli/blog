The Hamburger Menu is a common mobile navigation pattern, but its implementation can be tricky.
This post walks through a minimal, mostly native approach based on the `<dialog>` element.

## The open button

The open `<button>` should live inside the `<nav>` landmark to define its purpose and enhance its discoverability.

It should also have:

- `type="button"`, otherwise it would default to `"submit"`<FootnoteRef n="1"/>;
- a visually hidden text to provide an accessible name;
- a `title` with the same value, as a nice addition for sighted users<FootnoteRef n="2"/>;
- `aria-haspopup="dialog"` to provide more information to assistive technologies<FootnoteRef n="3"/>;
- the icon (I'm using a character here for simplicity).

```html
<button type="button" title="Open menu" aria-haspopup="dialog">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Open menu</span>
  <span aria-hidden="true">☰</span>
</button>
```

You could also add `aria-expanded`, but it would only makes sense if you are using a _non-modal_ dialog.

In our case we will be using a _modal_ dialog, which focus-traps the user and makes the rest of the page inert.
This creates a new interaction context rather than expanding the existing one, so an expanded state wouldn't be appropriate.

## The modal dialog

The modal `<dialog>` should have:

- an accessible name, provided via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`;
- `closedby="any"` to enable _light dismiss_ behavior<FootnoteRef n="4"/>.

Inside it, as the first element, there should be a `<button>` for closing it.
This can work with zero JavaScript if you enclose it in a `<form>` with `method="dialog"`<FootnoteRef n="5"/>.

Then comes the actual content of the `<dialog>`, which would be an exact copy of the list of links in your `<nav>` (but without the `<nav>` itself).

```html
<dialog aria-label="Menu" closedby="any">
  <form method="dialog">
    <button title="Close menu">
      <span class="visually-hidden">Close menu</span>
      <span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
    </button>
  </form>

  <!-- Navigation links -->
</dialog>
```

With the structure in place, only one thing is missing.

### Opening the dialog

In the near future, we will be able to open the dialog without a single line of JavaScript thanks to the

<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API">Invoker Commands API</Link>, which
has just entered baseline
<FootnoteRef n="6" />. For now, let us sprinkle in a bit of JavaScript:

```js
const menuToggle = document.getElementById("menu-toggle");
const menuDialog = document.getElementById("menu-dialog");

menuToggle?.addEventListener("click", () => menuDialog?.showModal());
```

Well, it ain't that bad.

### Styling it as a sidebar

I would like to style it as a sidebar while blurring the content of the page beneath it, so let us do that:

```css
.menu-dialog {
  position: fixed;
  height: 100%;
  width: 320px;
  max-width: 100%;
  left: auto;
}

.menu-dialog::backdrop {
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(0.25rem);
  backdrop-filter: blur(0.25rem);
}
```

But what about the animation? Here, take a look at this:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .menu-dialog,
  .menu-dialog::backdrop {
    transition:
      display 0.5s allow-discrete,
      overlay 0.5s allow-discrete,
      translate 0.5s,
      background-color 0.5s;
  }
}

.menu-dialog {
  translate: 100%;

  &::backdrop {
    background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0);
  }

  &[open] {
    translate: 0;

    &::backdrop {
      background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5);
    }
  }

  @starting-style {
    &[open] {
      translate: 100%;

      &::backdrop {
        background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There is a bunch of weird stuff in there, but suffice you to know that the `allow-discrete` plus `@starting-style` combo
is what's needed to enable transitions on properties that do not really have intermediate states,
and even if Firefox support is still lacking, this is another case of _progressive enhancement_, so no problem.

## The final structure

```html
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Primary">
    <!-- Navigation links -->

    <button type="button" title="Open menu" aria-haspopup="dialog">
      <span class="visually-hidden">Open menu</span>
      <span aria-hidden="true">☰</span>
    </button>

    <dialog aria-label="Menu" closedby="any">
      <form method="dialog">
        <button title="Close menu">
          <span class="visually-hidden">Close menu</span>
          <span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
        </button>
      </form>

      <!-- Navigation links -->
    </dialog>
  </nav>
</header>
```

What a gift! The web platform really handles most of the heavy lifting, and you end up with a nicely animated and accessible hamburger menu (with very little JavaScript code nevertheless).

Now go, be (and code) well!

    At the time of writing, Safari still does not support it, but it's a good example of _progressive enhancement_, as long as you provide other ways to close the modal (which you should anyway).

    In this case, it's important _not_ to override the default `type="submit"` value of the `<button>`, because that's exactly what makes it work, dismissing the dialog when the form is submitted (to nowhere).
